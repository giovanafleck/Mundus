# Mundus
Project for the Data Journalism course

Hello! 

In this repository you will find all the files and notebooks I used to investigate the so-called 'Airbnb effect' in Amsterdam. 
Inside the folder 'Airbnb-Project---Mundus' you will find a index.html page where the outcome of this investigation is presented in the form of a story. 

Thanks for reviewing my project and I hope you find it interesting!
